Create rabbit vm using Docker's RabbitMQ marketplace compute app

Now select the rabbitmq vm

Then follow instructions here: https://hub.docker.com/_/rabbitmq/

- I just ran the following step 
	------ ORIGINAL ------ docker run -d --hostname my-rabbit --name some-rabbit -p 8080:15672 rabbitmq:3-management
	docker run -d --hostname my-rabbit --name some-rabbit -p 8080:15672 -p 5672:5672 -p 5671:5671 rabbitmq:3-management

- Now test access to rabbitm mgmt plugin from host. To get IP address of container, see 'docker stuff' below.
	curl http://IP-ADDRESS-OF-CONTAINER:15672/

- To access from outside world, you need to add a 'Network Security Group' for port 8080 in same resource group as rabbit vm.
	See here - (ignore subnet section of article) - https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/virtual-machines-windows-nsg-quickstart-portal
